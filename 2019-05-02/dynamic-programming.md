# Dynamic Programming

What is it?

## Lucas

It's something to help you solve problems with recursion.

## Tiago

Not necessarily recursive...

## Robson

A composition of problems.  A solution that's taken from the solution to a smaller problem and so on.

### Greedy Algorithm

Also not sure, but have heard of it.

We have a bag that can hold W kilos.  We have a bunch of objects, each of which has a weight.  We want to put as many objects in the bag as we can so long as their combined weight is less than W.

We'd rather W things that weigh 1 than 1 thing that weighs W.

Now every object also has a value.  We want to maximize the total value of the objects in the bag.

Total weight is 36

Item	  A	  B	  C	  D
Value	  24	18	18	10
Weight	24	10	10	7
